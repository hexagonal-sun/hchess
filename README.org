#+TITLE: HChess

HChess is an attempt to learn haskell by means of writing a chess engine,
something I've [[https://github.com/hexagonal-sun/mace][previouisly done in C++]].

This software is in it's very early stages and only currently supports pretty
printing of an initial board state.

Current features:
 - Data types for Ranks and Files.
 - Define a tuple of (File, Rank) as a Locus.
 - Direction types and applications to Locus to generate a new Locus.
 - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Data-Ix.html][Ix]] implementation of Locus.
 - Piece data types:
   - Piece Kind
   - Colour
   - Piece
 - Board representaiton using [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Data-Ix.html][Array]] indexed by Locus
 - Creation of starting board.
 - Pretty printing of board layout.
